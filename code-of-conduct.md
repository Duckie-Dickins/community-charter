# Code of Conduct

1. **Embrace Diversity**: Woodcrest is a melting pot of roleplay experiences, languages, and styles. Whether you're a seasoned RPer or new to the scene, lead by example, offering guidance without elitism.

1. **Foster Openness**: Engaging in local chat helps include everyone. While private messages (IMs) have their place, especially for welcoming those less inclined to speak up, always respect privacy and consent to avoid harassment.

1. **Honor Boundaries**: Consent is key in roleplay. Avoid forcing unwelcome scenarios on others. Public events require participation by presence, but remember to seek approval for any significant environmental impact. Keep sensitive roleplay private and use discretion in public spaces to ensure comfort for all.

1. **Minimize Drama**: Approach conflicts constructively and respect the community by avoiding slander and toxicity. Strive for peaceful resolutions and maintain a positive environment.

1. **Enhance, Donâ€™t Replace**: Use shouts, dances, and gestures to complement, not overshadow, roleplay. Excessive or disruptive gestures, along with out-of-character shouts, are not permitted. Griefing, trolling, and unsolicited promotions are grounds for disciplinary action.

1. **Respect Events**: Do not interrupt scheduled events without prior agreement with the organizers. Understand the effort behind event planning and maintain a collaborative spirit.

1. **Respect Privacy**: Private spaces are off-limits without explicit permission. Circumventing locks or invading personal areas without consent is prohibited.

1. **Identify Yourself**: Wear the appropriate Woodcrest group tag. Use AFK zones or tags for extended absences, and remove out-of-character tags upon returning to roleplay.

1. **Keep a Light Heart**: Roleplay thrives on creativity and unexpected developments. Embrace the collective storytelling spirit without focusing solely on personal gains.

1. **Supportive Staff**: Treat staff with kindness and patience as they juggle multiple tasks and real-life responsibilities. They are eager to assist and engage in roleplay when possible, but may occasionally be delayed in response.
