# Woodcrest Code of Conduct

Welcome to Woodcrest, a community where diversity, creativity, and respect form the bedrock of our shared experience. As members of this vibrant world, it is crucial that we adhere to a code of conduct and sim rules that uphold the integrity and enjoyment of all participants. Here is our comprehensive guide to ensuring a positive, inclusive, and enriching environment for everyone:

1. **Embrace and Respect Diversity**: Woodcrest is a diverse mosaic of roleplay experiences and backgrounds. We champion inclusivity and encourage all members to lead by example, fostering an environment where guidance is given with respect, not elitism.

1. **Communication is Key**: Open and respectful communication, primarily through local chat, is encouraged to maintain inclusivity. While private messages have their place, consent and privacy must always be respected to prevent harassment.

1. **Consent and Boundaries**: Consent is the cornerstone of interaction here. Avoid imposing scenarios on others without their agreement. Public roleplay should not infringe on community comfort, and sensitive content must be approached with discretion. We strictly prohibit excessive violence and discriminatory language, both in public and private settings.

1. **Drama and Disruptions**: Constructive conflict resolution is essential. Slander, toxicity, and behaviors that disturb the peace are not tolerated. Scheduled events should not be interrupted without prior consent, emphasizing respect for the planning and effort involved.

1. **Roleplay Etiquette**: Enhancements like shouts and gestures should support, not overshadow, roleplay. We discourage any form of griefing, trolling, and spamming, as these actions detract from our collective experience.

1. **Privacy and Personal Space**: The sanctity of private spaces is to be maintained at all times. Unauthorized entry or the circumvention of security measures is forbidden.

1. **Community Identity**: Wear your Woodcrest group tag proudly. If you need to step away, please use designated AFK zones or tags to inform others.

1. **Maintain a Positive Spirit**: Keeping a light-hearted approach to roleplay enriches our shared stories. It's about "us," not just "me."

1. **Respect & Support Our Staff**: Our staff are here to assist and enhance your experience. While they strive to be attentive, please extend patience and understanding as they balance multiple responsibilities.

1. **Adherence to Standards**: All members must be 18 years or older and maintain avatars that reflect our real-world setting. We operate within the guidelines of Linden Labs' TOS and Community Standards, with any violations subject to appropriate actions.

By participating in Woodcrest, you agree to these principles, which are designed not only to safeguard individual rights but also to foster a community where creativity, engagement, and mutual respect can flourish. Together, let's make Woodcrest a beacon of exemplary roleplay and community spirit.
