# Rental Agreement and Conditions

When you choose to rent within Woodcrest, you're agreeing to adhere to the following conditions:
- Community and Compliance: As a tenant or subtenant, you must follow Woodcrest's sim rules and the Linden Labs TOS. Failure to comply could lead to eviction without a refund for any rule violations.
- Designated Uses: Units labeled as "Shop" are strictly for storefront or shop purposes and should not be used as residential spaces. Selling items or services for L$ in these shops requires Woodcrest staff approval.

### Land Group Membership
- Group Membership: To prevent automatic return of your objects, tenants and subtenants need to be part of the “Woodcrest Landgroup”. Invitations to the group are issued after rental payment.
- Group Invitation Issues: If you encounter problems receiving a group invite via the rental meter, please reach out to Woodcrest staff.

### Decorating and Prim Usage
- Lag Awareness: Decorate responsibly to avoid causing sim lag. Objects causing significant lag will be returned.
- Boundary Respect: Keep permanent prims within the boundaries of your rented space. Objects found outside these limits will be returned.
- Temporary Rezzing: Pets and vehicles can be rezzed temporarily during RP sessions but must not be left out permanently.
- Expiration: Items will be returned upon rental expiration.

### Fees and Rates
- Pricing: Rentals follow a rate of **L$2.5 per prim, with an additional L$25 maintenance fee**. Prim limits can be increased in increments of 10, subject to unit type and availability.

### Privacy and Security
- Roleplay and Privacy: While interaction is a part of the community, entering someone's residential unit without permission is not allowed (does not apply to shops). Use the proper channels to report any trespassing.
- Security Orbs: The use of security orbs is prohibited.

### Additional Terms
- Subletting: Subletting your rental is not allowed.
- Refunds: No refunds are provided, but credit can be transferred between units.
- Rental Payments: If rent is overdue, continuing to rent the same unit may result in a deduction from your meter equal to the overdue period, ensuring fairness among all renters.
