# Woodcrest Roleplay Group Proposal Template

Thank you for your interest in creating a roleplay group for our Second Life town, Woodcrest. Please fill out the following template to submit your group proposal. Provide as much detail as possible to help us understand your group's concept and how it will fit into our town's roleplay environment.

## üìú Group Name and Type

- Provide your group's name
- Classify its type (e.g., law enforcement, criminal organization, business, social club, etc.)
- Include an alignment descriptor (e.g., lawful good, chaotic neutral, lawful evil)

**Example:** "Woodcrest Guardian Angels - Vigilante Group (Chaotic Good)"

## üèõÔ∏è Group Backstory

- Describe your group's origin and how it fits into Woodcrest's history
- Explain the group's evolution and current standing in the community

**Example:** "Founded in 2010 after a series of unsolved crimes, the Woodcrest Guardian Angels started as a neighborhood watch program. Over time, they've evolved into a well-organized vigilante group, operating in the grey areas of the law to protect Woodcrest citizens."

## üé≠ Group Goals and Motives

- List 3-5 primary objectives for your group
- Explain the driving forces behind these goals

**Example:**
1. Reduce crime rates in Woodcrest by 30% within a year
2. Establish a network of informants throughout the town
3. Gain public support and recognition as a legitimate peacekeeping force

**Motive:** The Guardian Angels believe the official law enforcement is inadequate and corrupt, driving them to take matters into their own hands.

## üë• Group Structure and Hierarchy

- Outline the leadership roles and general member positions
- Describe how decisions are made within the group

**Example:**
- Leader: The Archangel (elected by senior members)
- Senior Members: Seraphim (5 positions)
- Regular Members: Guardians
- Recruits: Fledglings

Decisions are made through a council of Seraphim, with the Archangel having the final say.

## üÜï Onboarding Process

- Detail the steps for new members to join your group
- Include any trials, oaths, or initiation rituals

**Example:**
1. Potential recruits must be vouched for by an existing Guardian
2. Recruits undergo a month-long training program
3. Recruits must pass a physical fitness test and a moral dilemma scenario
4. New members swear an oath of loyalty and secrecy in a candlelit ceremony

## üè† Headquarters and Meeting Locations

- Describe your group's main base of operations
- List any secondary meeting spots or safe houses

**Example:** "The Guardian Angels operate from an abandoned fire station on the outskirts of Woodcrest. They also maintain several safe houses throughout the town, disguised as ordinary residences."

## üé≠ Roleplay Scenarios and Events

- Propose 2-3 potential roleplay scenarios involving your group
- Suggest any recurring events or activities your group would organize

**Example Scenarios:**
1. A high-profile kidnapping case that the police are struggling to solve

**Recurring Event:** Monthly self-defense classes for Woodcrest residents

## ü§ù Interactions with Other Groups

- Describe potential alliances or conflicts with existing Woodcrest groups
- Explain how your group might react to new groups forming in the town

**Example:** "The Guardian Angels have a tense relationship with the Woodcrest Police Department but maintain a secret alliance with certain honest officers. They are wary of new vigilante groups and may see them as potential rivals or threats to their operations."

## üìä Growth and Development Plans

- Outline how you envision your group evolving over time
- Include any long-term goals or aspirations

**Example:** "The Guardian Angels aim to establish a formal training academy for new members, expand their influence to neighboring towns, and ultimately force a reform of the Woodcrest Police Department through their actions and public pressure."

## üåü Unique Features or Characteristics

- Highlight any special aspects of your group that set it apart from others or make it particularly interesting for roleplayers

**Example:**
- Access to a network of hidden cameras throughout Woodcrest
