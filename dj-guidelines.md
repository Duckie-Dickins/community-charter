# Guidelines for Woodcrest DJs

We appreciate all campus DJs who provide music and entertainment for our community. As a DJ, you play a crucial role in enhancing the Woodcrest experience. Please review and acknowledge the following rules by contacting the DJ Manager.

## General Requirements
1. ONLY AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL may change land streams. This includes admins, Event Managers, and authorized event DJs.
2. DJING IS A PRIVILEGE, NOT A RIGHT. We expect DJs to be active in the community. Remember, we are a roleplay community first and foremost.
3. USE ONLY AUTHORIZED TIP JARS placed around the sim. Contact Dexy if one is needed elsewhere.
4. OBTAIN APPROVAL for random DJing when nothing is scheduled. Contact the DJ Manager or Event Manager first.

## Event and Streaming Guidelines
1. BE MINDFUL OF ONGOING OR UPCOMING EVENTS. Always contact the event DJ before putting in your stream.
2. DO NOT USE NON-STANDARD STREAMS during classes unless pre-approved (e.g., Cheer, Performing Arts, Dance Class).
3. ALL STREAMS MUST BE APPROVED by Dexy, the DJ Manager, or the Event Management Team.
4. INCLUDE DJ NAMES in event requests to avoid confusion.
5. DO NOT PUT IN STREAMS FOR UNAPPROVED DJs or anyone but yourself or another approved DJ without proper authorization.
6. NEW RADIO STREAMS AND UNAPPROVED DJs must be vetted through the DJ Manager, Event Management Team, or Dexy.

## Sim Tip Attribution
Performing at or on any Woodcrest event will require a 10% attribution tax from all performer tip jars. It's preferred that these tip jars are provided pre-configured by our administration staff, but should there be a scenario that prohibits it, please contact the administration staff for assistance.

## Strike System
1. FIRST STRIKE: Warning and 48-hour suspension for rule violations or disrespectful behavior.
2. SECOND STRIKE: Second warning and one-week suspension from DJing on campus.
3. THIRD STRIKE: Termination of campus DJing privileges.

Strikes can be removed after 3 months from the date of violation. Management reserves the right to bypass strikes for severe infractions.

## Additional Information
1. HOUSE LEADS wishing to add a house DJ should have them contact the DJ Manager, Event Management Team, or Dexy for roster inclusion.
2. THE DJ MANAGER regulates DJ use and streaming on campus. Address concerns to the DJ Manager, who can involve an Admin or Moderator if necessary.

These guidelines are designed to maintain a respectful and smooth-running environment for all. Let's share our love of music while upholding our community standards.
