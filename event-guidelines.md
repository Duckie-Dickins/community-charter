# Woodcrest Event Guidelines

## General Guidelines for Events

1. LOCATION: London Docks should be first priority as location for any event. Ideally ground level using existing location or structures (See below for location information). Alternatively Greek houses can use their house platforms for any events which require a skybox or special build, business or school related events can be held on the large events platform above London Docks. If a very large area is needed, and with permission of the Events Coordinator, the Event Platform above the Ocean Sim can be used.
2. PRIM LIMITS: Decor and/or Builds for events should be kept under 500 LI. With approval from the Events Coordinator, this can go as high as 1000 LI if needed. Event planners should make every effort to keep prims under the maximum limits and make use of low LI items in their builds and decor.
3. BUSINESSES: Businesses holding events will need to abide by the same rules as above, however if holding an event outside of their business location, the event build and location will need pre-approval from the Events Coordinator.
4. SETUP & TEARDOWN: Events should not be set up more than a week prior to the event date, and should ideally be set up as close to the event date as possible. All event builds and decor should be removed within 24 hours after the event has taken place.

The following locations can be used for events without requiring prior approval:
- Beach
- Boardwalk
- Bowling Alley
- Arcade
- The Yacht 
- Community Events Center (white barn bldg behind Tight Ends, near the beach)

The following locations can be used for events but must be requested for approval by the managers:
- Tight Ends (see Adam Spade (Darkheart 60110))
- Chandelier Room (See Sharon Skydancer)
- The Hot Springs (See Strawberry Moo)

Greek Houses may use the Greek Quad lawn or pool for any events. The football field is available for any school related events. The green lawn space on the North Sim may be used if requested in advance, with approval of the Event Coordinator. If needed, the streets can be blocked off for an event but must be pre-approved by the Events Coordinator and the PD will need to provide blockades.

NOTE: All of the above locations may be decorated as needed for events, within the allowed prim limits, however no buildings or large structures may be used without prior approval of the Events Coordinator.

## Woodcrest Calendar Guidelines For Events

Priority of Scheduling:

1. University Classes or Activities
2. Student Council, Greek Council or Faculty meetings and events
3. Greek House meetings and events
4. Business events (clubs, bars, stores, etc) and Band Events - see below for additional info)

Note: Greek "house only" events can be added to the calendar but are for informational purposes only and do not guarantee them that time slot. Any other scheduling will take priority over a "house only" event. It is recommended that Greek Houses use their own calendar to keep track of their "house only" events or activities.

**Definitions:**
Prime Time = Friday starting time of 4pm, all day Saturday and all day Sunday.
Non-Prime Time = any other time or day of week than the above.


### Scheduling Rules:

1. WC classes and school related events, such as Student Council, Greek Council, Performing Arts, Cheer etc., are top priority and can be posted at any time in advance. Student Council maintains absolute event scheduling priority during Spirit Week and Homecoming Week, the dates for which must be approved by the mod team. Greek Council maintains absolute event scheduling priority during Rush weeks. Greek Council and Student Council may together designate any major holiday for a jointly sponsored event.
2. Greek House events can be posted to the calendar no more than one month in advance.
3. Greek houses may schedule a maximum of 3 prime time events per month, and unlimited non-prime time events. 
4. Greek house and other meetings which are Greek or university related may be scheduled as ongoing events which run thru the year.
5. Businesses (Clubs, Bars, etc. including, but not limited to Tight Ends, Chandelier Room, etc.) can post events no more than one month in advance. They may schedule 2 exclusive prime time events per month and post unlimited events on the university calendar in NON-prime times. 
6. Bands can schedule one month in advance for one exclusive prime time slot per month. Other band performances are considered “soft” but as an RP activity they can pop up at any time and claim priority for the stream over other “soft” events
7. If a prime time slot is open on the calendar, a Greek House, Business, DJ or Band can hold a 'pop-up', or spontaneous event, but only if it is scheduled on the day of the event.
8. Maximum time allowance for an event is 4 hours. If more time is needed for an event, then a request can be made but is subject to approval from the Events Coordinator.
 9. If there is nothing on the calendar following an event, It is up to the discretion of whoever is holding the event to carry it longer, if desired. However if there is a class, meeting, other event, or anything else on the schedule immediately following an event, then the event must be wrapped up at the ending time. It is also a courtesy for whoever is holding the event to announce whatever is following to the event guests.

Note:  All calendar postings will be done on a first come, first served basis. It is recommended to get your events posted early so that you are guaranteed the time slot that you want.

### Posters

Event Posters should be submitted at the time or shortly after an event has been placed on the Calendar and should include a date and time as well as the information as to who is holding or sponsoring the event. Posters should be submitted to the Events Coordinator and if you would like your poster to be included in the Beaver Pride Newspaper you may also provide a copy to the editor. Poster dimensions should be 3:4 aspect ratio (example: 1024 pixels tall x 768 wide).
