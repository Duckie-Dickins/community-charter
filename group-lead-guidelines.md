# Guidelines for Group Leads

​We’re happy to have you on board, working to make Woodcrest a better and more fun place for everyone!  As a group lead, you are a key pillar in the wider community, as well as responsible for the welfare, activity, and character of your particular group.

Thus you should hold yourself to a higher standard than that of other players on the sim.  As such, we provide for you requirements and guidelines below:

​
## Personal Requirements
1. We request your REGULAR PRESENCE ON SIM with a minimum of 10 hours each week, and at least 4 different days each week.  Preferably more.  It is difficult to build a group or contribute meaningfully without an active presence.  We request that you notify us if there are weeks when you cannot meet this demand (e.g. due to work, illness, vacation, etc.).
1. YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE COMMITMENTS AT OTHER SIMS.  We don’t demand that you have no participation in other sims, but we do request that you do not divide your SL loyalty and investment with other sims.  We hope for you to view Woodcrest as your home.
1. CREATE A WOODCREST RP PROFILE IN YOUR SL PROFILE PICKS.  We’re entrusting you to represent the sim, and to oversee those who join your group.  We’d appreciate at least this expression of commitment to us.

## Group Requirements
1. RUN EVENTS.  The frequency is negotiable based on the size and nature of your group and the events, but as a rule of thumb, 1 major event per month, open to the wider sim community, is a desirable goal.
1. ROLEPLAY WITH THE BROADER COMMUNITY as well as within your own group.  The goal is to build the sim.  And you may find that your own group will grow more steadily if people see you actively meeting others rather than isolating yourself in your own space.
1. ENCOURAGE ON-SIM PRESENCE OF GROUP MEMBERS.  Same reasons as #2.  We won’t stop occasional group off-sim excursions (indeed, some things such as sporting competitions with other schools may be appropriate as long as you are clearly identified with Woodcrest), but ask that this be the exception rather than the rule.  Do not create off-sim spaces for your group.
1. KEEP GROUP COMMUNICATION WITHIN WOODCREST’S MODERATED GROUPS.  While it’s not our business whether you create private channels with your personal friends, on-sim groups should be just that:  on-sim, and accessible to sim staff.  If you need a private space for your group, please discuss it with sim staff, and we may offer some on-sim.

## Other Guidelines
1. BRAINSTORM THE CHARACTER OF YOUR GROUP and consider steps that should be taken to implement it.  Are you going to be focussed more on light-hearted RP?  Do you wish to develop a story-arc for your group?
1. COLLABORATE ON EVENTS AND RP WITH OTHER GROUP LEADS.  We have unique ways to mutually enhance one another.  If playing a conflict between your group and another, obtain prior OOC permission from the other leads first, and make sure this is properly communicated with the members of your group.  Provide accommodation for members who wish to opt out, within reason, although there may be a point where the dissenting members might wish to consider if they are a good fit for the group.
1. SIM STAFF are here to help address drama that you are not able to resolve.  If there is a violation of sim rules or Linden Labs TOS, please report it to the staff immediately.
