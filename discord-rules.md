## Discord Server Rules

1. **Be Respectful:** Show respect to all members of the Woodcrest Discord server. Harassment and bullying are not allowed in any form and may result in being muted or kicked.

1. **Follow Discord’s Rules:** Don’t do anything that would get yourself or this server banned from Discord. You can find the full list of Discord’s community guidelines here: https://discord.com/guidelines

1. **Follow Real-World Laws:** We do not allow discussion of anything that relates to breaking real-world laws. This includes topics like hacking or doxing.

1. **No Adult Content:** This is a community server. We do not allow discussion of adult or NSFW content, and images / video containing NSFW material are prohibited.

1. **No Offensive Profiles:** Profile names or pictures containing adult or offensive material will asked to be changed.

1. **No Spamming:** Please do not send a large volume of small messages in the server repeatedly. This makes it difficult for other people to follow and engage in discussions.

1. **No Advertising:** We do not allow users to advertise their own products, services, sims or servers, including in private messages. Do not use our server to spam or advertise to other Discord users.

1. **Abide By The Decisions Of Moderators:** Moderators reserve the right to kick, ban or mute server members at their discretion, even if a rule on this list was not violated. If you believe that you have been treated unfairly by a moderator, please contact the administrator.

1. **Linden Labs TOS and Community Guidelines Apply:** Since this is a Discord server for a Second Life community, we will extend the Linden Labs TOS and Community Guidelines to this server. Violation may result in a suspension and/or ban from Woodcrest and the Woodcrest Discord server.

1. **Update Server Nickname:** Your SL display name used in Woodcrest MUST be used as your server profile name here.

### Contact Staff For Questions

Staff: @Discord Mod 

If you have questions about what is and isn’t allowed to be posted, contact staff before proceeding. If you are unsure if something breaks server rules, wait for a moderator to tell you that it’s okay. If you are unsure, err on the side of caution and avoid posting it.
