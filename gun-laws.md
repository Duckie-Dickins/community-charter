# Woodcrest Gun Laws

In Woodcrest, Massachusetts, we prioritize the safety and security of our community through a stringent gun registration process managed by the Police Department. Citizens 21 years old or older seeking to own a gun must visit the Police Station to complete the necessary forms and undergo a background check to be issued a Lincese to Carry Firearms.


#Gun Registration

To purchase, possess, and carry a firearm throughout the state, Massachusetts residents must apply for a License to Carry Firearms (LTC). With the LTC permit, you can purchase, possess, and transport all legal handguns, rifles, shotguns, magazines, feeding devices, and ammunition.  Massachusetts does not engage in reciprocity with other states regarding concealed carry permits

#Open Carry

It's important to note that Woodcrest is not open carry friendly; weapons found on individuals in public will be confiscated. Additionally, those with a criminal background are ineligible for a firearm license. This process underscores our dedication to responsible gun ownership and the collective well-being of all residents in Woodcrest.

#Carrying on School Property

It is illegal to carry an unloaded or loaded firearm in any building or on the grounds of any school, college, or university without the written authorization of the board or officer in charge of the school, college, or university.  The crime is punishable by up to two years in prison, a fine of up to $1,000, or both.
