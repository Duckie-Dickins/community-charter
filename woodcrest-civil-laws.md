# Woodcrest Civil Laws & Regulations
 
To comply with Woodcrest's commitment to safety and order, the following civil laws and regulations are in effect:

- The maximum speed limit on main streets is set at 40 mph. In residential areas, the speed limit is reduced to 25 mph to ensure the safety of our community members. Around the university premises, the speed limit is further lowered to 15 mph, reflecting the high pedestrian traffic and active environment.
- These speed limits apply universally to all forms of transportation, including cars, bicycles, and animals used for riding. This comprehensive approach ensures consistency and safety for all moving within Woodcrest.
- The possession and use of firearms on university grounds are strictly prohibited, except for individuals who have been explicitly authorized to do so. This measure is in place to maintain a secure and safe campus environment for all students, faculty, and visitors.

Adherence to these regulations is essential for the well-being and security of the Woodcrest community.


## Massachusetts State Law
​
Under Massachusetts State Law, several important regulations are established to ensure the safety and legality of actions within the state:

- Marijuana possession is limited to 1 ounce on your person and 10 located at your residence.  Only adults over the age of 21 are allowed to use marijuana and only within their private residence.  Public consumption is illegal unless specific Special Requests are made prior to the event.
- Indecent exposure, defined as the willful exposure of one's genitals in any public place, is considered a criminal act. Exceptions to this law include  activities within the scope of authorized adult-oriented businesses, where such exposure is regulated under specific conditions.
- For the operation of motor vehicles, possession of firearms, and use of medical marijuana, individuals are required to obtain the appropriate licenses from the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). These licenses serve as official documentation of an individual's eligibility and legal right to engage in these activities, ensuring compliance with state regulations.

Adherence to these laws is critical for maintaining the legal and social fabric of North Carolina, protecting the rights and safety of its residents.


## United States Federal Law​

Under United States Federal Law, the legal age for alcohol consumption is set at 21 years old.

This regulation aims to reduce alcohol-related accidents and health issues among younger populations, promoting responsible drinking practices across the country. Compliance with this law is mandatory, and failure to adhere can result in legal consequences for both individuals and establishments serving alcohol.
